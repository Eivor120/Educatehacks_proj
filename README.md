Empowering philanthropy through seamless and hassle-free donation allocation.

## What it does
Donation Allocation Aid simplifies donation distribution by analyzing user-provided information and allocating funds to causes based on predefined criteria. Users input details like income, marital status, and location, and the system maximizes impact across philanthropic endeavors.

## What we learned
Throughout the development process, we gained insights into aid allocation complexities and user-centric design. Collaborating as a team allowed us to leverage each other's strengths effectively. Additionally, we deepened our understanding of algorithm development and frontend-backend integration.

## What's next for Donation Allocation Aid
As a basic MVP prototype developed over a weekend, our vision for Donation Allocation Aid is to evolve it into a seamless and hassle-free platform for philanthropy. We aim to refine the algorithm, enhance user experience, and scale the platform to serve a broader audience. Our goal is to empower users to effortlessly contribute to different causes in today's busy world. With continued dedication and support, Donation Allocation Aid has the potential to become a comprehensive solution that maximizes philanthropic impact effectively.
